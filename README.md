# Human Bean Routine

Some people would consider growing beans to be a low effort task. "All they need is water, nutrients, sunlight and warmth". But all of those "easy" things aren't easy for everyone, especially if you haven't built up a routine for it.

As a human bean, it can take a lot of work to build a routine of "basic tasks" like drinking water or going to bed on time.

What we aim to do is to provide some external structure and motivation to help human beans reach their goals and feel good about it!  You unlock puzzles and encouraging messages to give you a sense of pride and accomplishment as you complete your tasks.
